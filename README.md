# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Rating Prediction | CodSoft Internship â€“ Task 2

This project is part of **Task 2** of my internship at **CodSoft**. The objective is to build a machine learning model that predicts a movie's rating based on attributes like **genre**, **director**, and **lead actor**.

We use regression techniques to analyze historical IMDb movie data and estimate the movie rating (given by users or critics) with high accuracy.
